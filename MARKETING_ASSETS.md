### Post 1: Security Assessment Value
```
Most organizations don't know where their security gaps are until it's too late.

A comprehensive security assessment changes that. You get:
✓ Clear visibility into your risk landscape
✓ Prioritized recommendations (not just a list of problems)
✓ A practical roadmap to close gaps
✓ Confidence in your security posture

If you've been meaning to assess your organization's security, let's talk. We help healthcare providers, professional services firms, and SaaS companies reduce cyber risk with structured, evidence-based guidance.

Ready to understand your security posture? Book a consultation.

### Post 2: HIPAA Compliance
```
HIPAA compliance isn't a one-time project—it's an ongoing commitment.

Many organizations struggle with:
• Understanding what HIPAA actually requires
• Identifying gaps in their current controls
• Building sustainable compliance practices
• Managing vendor security assessments

We help healthcare organizations navigate HIPAA requirements with clarity and confidence. Our approach is practical, not theoretical.

If HIPAA compliance is on your radar, let's connect.

#HIPAA #HealthcareCompliance #CyberSecurity #HealthIT
```

### Post 3: Cloud Security
```
Your Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace environment is critical to your business. But is it secure?

Common gaps we see:
❌ Weak MFA enforcement
❌ Excessive admin access
❌ Unmanaged external sharing
❌ Missing conditional access policies

A cloud security review takes 2-4 weeks and gives you clear visibility into your identity and access posture.
